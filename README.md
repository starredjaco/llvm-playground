# llvm-playground
This project exists just because I wanted to learn a little about compilers and LLVM too.

## Whats done...
Currently only lexer has been written.

1. Lexer - converts the code/texts (at that moment) to some meaningful chunks called tokens.
- More specifically this has currently capability of converting some symbols, some arithmetic operators, some data types, return and numbers into tokens. And removing spaces and comments (starting with: "#").

## Build steps

```sh
cmake -B build #using cmake i felt its easier
cd build #cmake will make Makefiles here
make #build it
```
- and test input files are in `tests/*.ie`
